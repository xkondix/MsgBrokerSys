# test-0

On this branch are compared values such as the mean or median for different numbers of samples. Samples of 1,2,5,10,15 and 20 have been made. The purpose of this research is to select the number of repetitions to perform for subsequent tests. To perform the tests, no additional operations were added to the streams, the only task of the stream is transfer from "Order" topic to "Summary" topic.

Examples of results used for test below (folder "results"), instead of *, insert numbers from 1-20.

- test_kafka_d3_full_*
- test_kafka_d0_full_*
- test_kafka_d0_half_*

- test_spark_d3_full_*
- test_spark_d0_full_*
- test_spark_d0_half_*

The charts and reports created from the results are located in the "dataAfterAnalysis" folder.
