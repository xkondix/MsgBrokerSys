Spark Streaming:

The service is designed to process data in real time. The entry point is a Kafka Topic called Order, and the exit point is a Kafka Topic called Summary.


Information about the application:
- uses version 3.4.0 of spark libraries.
- uses Spark Structured Streaming to process the stream [1]
- uses Java 17
- uses Spring boot 2.7.10 version [2]
- uses Apache Hadoop 3.3.1 version


Requirements to run the application:
- install versions of Apache Hadoop on your computer, or download some image and run it
- if you have a windows system, you need to move additional files to the bin folder of the Apache Hadoop application [3]
- in my case, I had to add paths to Apache Hadoop folders to VM options [4]
- if you want to process data from kafka, then you need to run the zookeeper and kafka image from docker compose file
- to produce data you need to run the Producer service


Spark Structured Streaming [1] ->
I use Spark Structured Streaming instead of Spark Streaming because it is newer and supported. Links to read:
- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42075
- https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#note

Spring Boot version [2] ->
The application uses Spring boot version 2.7.10 because it is missing the Jersey servlet and maybe other things, 
or it has an incompatible version of the component data with Spark 3.4.0 on Spring Boot version 3.0.5 , so it can't run properly.


Additional files [3] ->
Repo with additional files to copy and past to folder bin https://github.com/kontext-tech/winutils/tree/master/hadoop-3.3.1/bin.
For more detailed instructions https://kontext.tech/article/829/install-hadoop-331-on-windows-10-step-by-step-guide. 
On linux you should not have this problem.


VM options [4] ->
    --add-exports
    java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED
    --add-opens=java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED
    -Dhadoop.home.dir=C:/hadoop-3.3.1
    -Djava.library.path=C:/hadoop-3.3.1/bin
