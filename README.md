# test-6

The test focuses on measuring the time taken by Kafka Streams and Spark Structured Streaming to calculate the average.
Operations used in data processing :
- Reading values from Topic "Order"
- Filtering invalid data that has a value of 0. I inserted 0 for missing fields with a value.
- Grouping data by id key
- Aggregation of values (counting average and number of processed values)
- Sending results on Topic "Summary"

As for the results, in the Python script I took into consideration only the last result. I did so because I set timestampSend as the first timestamp during agg.
The test has 3 configurations, which are described at the end of the description.

### Input data
The data used for testing is taken from the file "DsDusznikMOB_PM25.csv". The full set is 8760, half 4380. After rejecting invalid data, the full set is 8646, half 4313.
- The correct average for 8646 is 20,34888
- The correct average for 4313 is 24,42601031

### Kafka Streams
In the case of Kafka, I used an helper class (DataCalc) to calculate the values. 

### Spark Structured Streaming
In the Spark solution, I used the built-in functions for avg and count. In addition, I used update mode as output mode, which allowed me to not send data from previous aggregations.

### Problems
The problem was the use of grouping without time windows. Time windows eliminate many problems like clearing values for a key after grouping. I solved this in both cases by adding a new id field that is generated in the IoTSimulation class for the entire sample.

### Results
Examples of results used for test below (folder "results"), instead of *, insert numbers from 1-10.

- test_kafka_d3_full_*

- test_kafka_d0_full_*

- test_kafka_d0_half_*

- test_spark_d3_full_*

- test_spark_d0_full_*

- test_spark_d0_half_*

The reports created from the results are located in the "dataAfterAnalysis" folder.

### Configurations

Configurations are changed based on 2 classes, and look like this:

- d3_full -> This is a configuration that sends all data (8760) on Topic "Order" and sends it with a delay of 3ms.
- d0_full -> This is a configuration that sends all data (8760) on Topic "Order" and sends it with a delay of 0ms. The change occurs in the Prodcuer class.

- d0_half -> This is a configuration that sends half data (4380) on Topic "Order" and sends it with a delay of 0ms. The change occurs in the Prodcuer class and IoTSimulation class.
